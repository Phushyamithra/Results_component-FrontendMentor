## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

This project reinforced the importance of responsive design and working with various layout techniques like Flexbox and CSS Grid. I also gained experience with using CSS custom properties to maintain consistent styling throughout the project.

Example code snippet:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  position: relative;
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 30px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(177, 203, 241, 0.753);
  max-width: 650px;
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I aim to further explore advanced CSS techniques, especially in handling complex layouts and transitions. I'll also continue to work on improving accessibility features.

### Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) - This helped me understand Flexbox and how to align items effectively.
- [CSS-Tricks - A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - An excellent resource for understanding CSS Grid layout.
